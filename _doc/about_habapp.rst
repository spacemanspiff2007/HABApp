About HABApp
==================================

What is HABApp
------------------------------
HABApp is a Python rule engine.
It has a local item cache and can integrate external systems, e.g. openHAB and MQTT.
Rules can listen to events from the event bus. These events are generated by HABApp or by the external systems.
Additionally there is a scheduler available that makes time based triggering very easy.
