_Easy automation with MQTT and/or openHAB_


HABApp is a asyncio/multithread application that connects to an openHAB instance and/or a MQTT broker.
It is possible to create rules that listen to events from these instances and then react accordingly.

## Goals
The goal of this application is to provide a simple way to create home automation rules in python.
With full syntax highlighting and descriptive names it should almost never be required to look something up in the documentation

## Documentation
[The documentation can be found at here](https://habapp.readthedocs.io)

## Help out
HABApp was created for my own use, but I wanted others to profit from it, too.
Creating, maintaining and developing it takes a lot of time.
If you think this is a great tool and want to support it you can donate,
so I can buy some more coffee to keep development going. :wink:

All donations are greatly appreciated!


## Examples

### MQTT Rule example
```python
import datetime
import random

import HABApp
from HABApp.mqtt.items import MqttItem
from HABApp.core.events import ValueChangeEvent, ValueChangeEventFilter, ValueUpdateEvent, ValueUpdateEventFilter


class ExampleMqttTestRule(HABApp.Rule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.run.every(
            start_time=datetime.timedelta(seconds=60),
            interval=datetime.timedelta(seconds=30),
            callback=self.publish_rand_value
        )

        # this will trigger every time a message is received under "test/test"
        self.listen_event('test/test', self.topic_updated, ValueUpdateEventFilter())

        # This will create an item which will store the payload of the topic so it can be accessed later.
        self.item = MqttItem.get_create_item('test/value_stored')
        # Since the payload is now stored we can trigger only if the value has changed
        self.item.listen_event(self.item_topic_updated, ValueChangeEventFilter())

    def publish_rand_value(self):
        print('test mqtt_publish')
        self.mqtt.publish('test/test', str(random.randint(0, 1000)))

    def topic_updated(self, event: ValueUpdateEvent):
        assert isinstance(event, ValueUpdateEvent), type(event)
        print( f'mqtt topic "test/test" updated to {event.value}')

    def item_topic_updated(self, event: ValueChangeEvent):
        print(self.item.value)  # will output the current item value
        print( f'mqtt topic "test/value_stored" changed from {event.old_value} to {event.value}')


ExampleMqttTestRule()
```

### openHAB rule example

```python
import HABApp
from HABApp.core.events import ValueUpdateEvent, ValueChangeEvent, ValueChangeEventFilter, ValueUpdateEventFilter
from HABApp.openhab.events import ItemCommandEvent, ItemStateUpdatedEventFilter, ItemCommandEventFilter, \
  ItemStateChangedEventFilter


class MyOpenhabRule(HABApp.Rule):

  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()

    # Trigger on item updates
    self.listen_event('TestContact', self.item_state_update, ItemStateUpdatedEventFilter())
    self.listen_event('TestDateTime', self.item_state_update, ValueUpdateEventFilter())

    # Trigger on item changes
    self.listen_event('TestDateTime', self.item_state_change, ItemStateChangedEventFilter())
    self.listen_event('TestSwitch', self.item_state_change, ValueChangeEventFilter())

    # Trigger on item commands
    self.listen_event('TestSwitch', self.item_command, ItemCommandEventFilter())

  def item_state_update(self, event: ValueUpdateEvent):
    assert isinstance(event, ValueUpdateEvent)
    print(f'{event}')

  def item_state_change(self, event: ValueChangeEvent):
    assert isinstance(event, ValueChangeEvent)
    print(f'{event}')

    # interaction is available through self.openHAB or self.oh
    self.openhab.send_command('TestItemCommand', 'ON')

  def item_command(self, event: ItemCommandEvent):
    assert isinstance(event, ItemCommandEvent)
    print(f'{event}')

    # interaction is available through self.openhab or self.oh
    self.oh.post_update('TestItemUpdate', 123)

- Docker file changed to a multi stage build. Mount points changed to ``/habapp/config``.

**Migration to new version**


``self.listen_event`` now requires an instance of EventFilter.

Old:
```python
from HABApp.core.events import ValueUpdateEvent
...
self.my_sensor = Item.get_item('my_sensor')
self.my_sensor.listen_event(self.movement, ValueUpdateEvent)
```

New:
```python
from HABApp.core.events import ValueUpdateEventFilter
...
self.my_sensor = Item.get_item('my_sensor')
self.my_sensor.listen_event(self.movement, ValueUpdateEventFilter())   # <-- Instance of EventFilter
```

```text
HABApp:
  ValueUpdateEvent -> ValueUpdateEventFilter()
  ValueChangeEvent -> ValueChangeEventFilter()

Openhab:
  ItemStateEvent        -> ItemStateEventFilter()
  ItemStateChangedEvent -> ItemStateChangedEventFilter()
  ItemCommandEvent      -> ItemCommandEventFilter()

MQTT:
  MqttValueUpdateEvent -> MqttValueUpdateEventFilter()
  MqttValueChangeEvent -> MqttValueChangeEventFilter()
```

**Migration to new docker image**
- change the mount point of the config from ``/config`` to ``/habapp/config``
- The new image doesn't run as root. You can set `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` to the user you want habapp to run with. It's necessary to modify the permissions of the mounted folder accordingly.
